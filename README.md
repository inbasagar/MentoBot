# MentoBot
Hey Greetings,We are from Team Random Ideas,Creating solutions for community Welfare.
Let me Introduce you to Mentobot which a bot 
MentoBot is well suited to growing a polycrop of many common garden veggies at the same time. Crops we've had success with include Bok Choy, Lettuces, Radish, Beets, Chard, Arugula, Broccoli, and much more.
By placing vining and other indeterminate crops near the ends of the bed and training them outwards, you can easily double or triple the area your plants can utilize while still being maintained by the FarmBot.
